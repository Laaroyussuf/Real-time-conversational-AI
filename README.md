# Real-Time Conversational AI with Avatar Response

This project is a real-time conversational AI application built using **Streamlit** and **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**. The app integrates with the **D-ID API** to generate an avatar video response based on the AI model's reply, allowing users to have an engaging conversation experience with **Vastlearn-AI**.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Users interact with Vastlearn-AI via text input, and responses are generated by Google Generative AI (Gemini).
- **Avatar Video Response**: The AI’s text responses are synthesized into videos with an animated avatar, powered by the D-ID API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean chat interface displaying only the user’s messages, followed by the avatar video response.

## Demo

The application provides a text input field where users can type messages to Vastlearn-AI. After submitting, the AI processes the conversation history, generates a response, and displays the avatar video with the AI’s spoken reply.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up API keys**:
    - Obtain API keys from Google Generative AI (Gemini) and D-ID, and save them securely in Streamlit secrets.
    - Add these API keys to your `secrets.toml` file under `.streamlit`:
    ```toml
    [general]
    api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    did_api_key = "YOUR_DID_API_KEY"
    ```

## Usage

Run the application using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
