# Real-Time Conversational AI with Avatar Response

This project is a real-time conversational AI application built using **Streamlit** and **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**. The app integrates with the **D-ID API** to generate an avatar video response based on the AI model's reply, enabling users to have a more interactive and engaging conversation with **Vastlearn-AI**. The AI responds naturally in real-time, and the avatar enhances the interaction with facial expressions, making it feel more lifelike.

## Features

- **Real-Time Conversational AI**: Users interact with Vastlearn-AI through text input, with responses generated by **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**.
- **Avatar with Facial Expressions**: The AI’s text responses are visually represented by an animated avatar powered by the **D-ID API**, incorporating facial expressions to enhance communication.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: The avatar speaks the AI-generated responses, with synchronized mouth movements to match the spoken text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The clean chat interface displays the conversation history, where the user’s message is followed by the avatar video response, allowing for smooth interaction.

## Demo

The application allows users to communicate with **Vastlearn-AI** by typing messages. After submitting the message, the AI processes the conversation history and generates a response, which is displayed as an avatar video with the AI's spoken reply. This provides a natural, engaging interaction, where the avatar uses facial expressions that complement the conversation.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up API keys**:
    - Obtain API keys from **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** and **D-ID** and store them securely in Streamlit secrets.
    - Add these API keys to your `secrets.toml` file under the `.streamlit` folder:
    ```toml
    [general]
    api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    did_api_key = "YOUR_DID_API_KEY"
    ```

## Usage

Run the application using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Architecture 
- Google Generative AI (Gemini) is used for generating natural language responses based on the conversation context.
- D-ID API is utilized to generate avatar video responses with facial expressions, making the interaction more lifelike.
- The real-time communication is facilitated by Streamlit, which updates the interface dynamically as the user interacts with the AI.

## Deployment
This solution is designed to be deployed as a web application, utilizing Streamlit for the front-end interface. It can be deployed on any cloud platform that supports Python applications, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Latency in Video Generation**
The video response from the D-ID API can take time to generate, especially if there is heavy server load. The solution involves a retry mechanism that checks the video status until it's ready.

2. **Avatar Facial Expressions & Synchronization**
Ensuring that the facial expressions align with the conversation requires integrating real-time status checks and configuring appropriate expression mappings based on context.

## Future Improvements
- **Voice Input:** Adding the ability for users to interact with Vastlearn-AI using voice input would enhance accessibility and provide a richer user experience.

- **Latency:** Improving latency in video generation is an ongoing improvement area. Faster video generation would provide a smoother, more responsive user experience.

- **Multiple User Support:** Implementing multi-user support would make the system scalable, allowing more users to interact with the AI simultaneously.

- **Avatar Gestures:** Gesture integration is actively being worked on to further enhance the avatar's expressiveness and interactivity in response to conversations.
